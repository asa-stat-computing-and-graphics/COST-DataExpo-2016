# TaxonomyOfBusCrashes-
This repository contains supplementary materials for the paper by Roy et al. (2021) to enable the reader to reproduce the numerical analysis and the graphical results presented in that paper.

The full reference is: Roy, D., Deshpande, V., Linder, M. H. (2021) "A cluster-based taxonomy of bus crashes in the United States", Computational Statistics 36(3): 1621-1638.

To reproduce the graphs and the data for the tables, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/COSTDataChallenge2016/TaxonomyOfBusCrashes-.git
```
2. Download the GES data: [ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/GES/](ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/GES/) (You only need the data from 2005-2015)
3. Install the following R packages as you usually do: data.table, dplyr, bit64, sas7bdat, devtools, magrittr, FactoMineR, dbscan, cluster, cclust, WeightedCluster, fmsb
4. [Download v2.0.19 of R package *kohonen* from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/kohonen/) and 
install from source:
```r
install.packages("~/Downloads/kohonen_2.0.19.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```
5. In *wrapper.R*, change `base_dir` to wherever you've cloned the repo, and change `data_base_dir` to wherever you've downloaded the GES data to. Run this file. The program will put all generated output in `base_dir/out`.

In the repo, you can find an "author_intermediate" directory that contains our intermediate output, and an "author_out" directory that contains the figures and tables from the paper, so that you can compare your outputs with ours.
